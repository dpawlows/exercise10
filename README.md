# Exercise 09

For this exercise, create a file called pandasDA.py and add the code
necessary to complete the exercises in that file.

Problem 1
---------
Creating and manipulating a data frame.

1. Create a data frame that contains all of the information shown in the table in the file [stellar.jpg](stellar.jpg). Then, use the methods or
attributes of the data frame object to complete the following activities (i.e. don't just hard code the answers).
2. Print the shape of the data frame.
3. Print the maximum distance observed.
4. Sort the data frame by Absolute Magnitude and print the sorted data frame.
5. Get a subset of the data frame that only contains distance and absolute magnitude, sorted by absolute magnitude. Save the result to a new variable.
6. Convert this new data frame to a numpy array using the `to_numpy()`
  method of the data frame. Save the result to a new variable. Then,
  use the numpy array to plot the absolute magnitude as a function of distance. Save the plot as magVsDistance.png.
